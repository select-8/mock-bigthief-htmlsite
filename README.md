#USER CENTRIC FRONT END MILESTONE PROJECT

## STATIC WEBSITE FOR THE FOLK-ROCK BAND _BIG THIEF_

###Project Overview

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.


####Owner Stories (redefining the scope)

Need a website to:

1. Target fans

 - make little from streaming actual albums, so ...
 - we need to sell merchandise and tickets to live shows

2. Showcase music

 - new album just out

 - rave reviews from the right places

3. Publicise their availability (tour)

 - dates

 - location

 - links to buy tickets

 - hero image of a live show atmosphere

4. Show photos of the band members

     - should fit the brand, are they the type of band to have a photo gallery?

5. Show videos
     - a mix of staged and live

6. Have audio clips

     - albums or songs or both?

7. Build a social media presence

    - not so important for the band but they realise fans might be interested

8. Be a reflection of the band's persona*

####User Stories

As a user I want to be able to:

 1 seamlessly navigate to the content I want.

 2 seamlessly wander the site till I find something that interests me

Two types of users can be defined:

1. I’m already a fan of the band, I have all their albums…
    - As a user I expect the site to reflect the persona of the band.
    - As a user, I want easy access to unique content i.e. access to an offical store, definitive tour listings

2. I have just heard of this band and I want to find out more…
    - As a user, I want access to the band's social media.

    - As a user, I want to hear some of this bands music.
    - As a user, I want to see their music videos.

    - As a user, I want to see some live performances.
    - As a user, I want some biographic information on the group*
