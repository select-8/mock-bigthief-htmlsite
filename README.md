*Owner Stories*

Need a website to 
1. Target fans
 - make little from streaming actual albums, so ...
 - we need to sell merchandise and tickets to live shows
2. Showcase music
 - new album just out
 - rave reviews from the right places
3. Publicise their availability (tour)
 - dates
 - hero image of live show atmosphere
4. Show photos of the band members
 - should fit the brand, are they the type of band to have photo gallery?
5. Show videos
 - mix of staged and live
6. Have audio clips
 - albums or songs or both?
7. Build a social media presence
	- not so important for the band but they realise fans might be interested 

*User Stories*

As a user I want to be able to
 a) seemlessly navigate to the content I want
 b) seemlessly wander the site till I find something that interests me

Two types of users can be defined:

1. I’m already a fan of the band, I have all their albums…
 - As a user I expect the site to reflect the persona of the band.
 - As a user I want unique content i.e. access to offical store, definitive tour schedule 

2. I have just heard of this band and I want to find out more…
 - As a user I want to hear some of this bands music
 - As a user I want to see their some music videos
 - As a user I want to see some live performances
