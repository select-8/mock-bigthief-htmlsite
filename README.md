## STATIC WEBITE FOR THE FOLK ROCK GROUP BIG THIEF

**Super Owner Stories**


**Owner Stories**

Need a website to
1. Target fans
     - make little from streaming actual albums, so ...
     - we need to sell merchandise and tickets to live shows
2. Showcase music
     - new album just out
     - rave reviews from the right places
3. Publicise their availability (tour)
     - dates
     - location
     - links to buy tickets
     - hero image of live show atmosphere
4. Show photos of the band members
     - should fit the brand, are they the type of band to have photo gallery?
5. Show videos
     - mix of staged and live
6. Have audio clips
     - albums or songs or both?
7. Build a social media presence
    - not so important for the band but they realise fans might be interested
8. Be a reflection of the bands persona*

**User Stories**

As a user I want to be able to
 1) seemlessly navigate to the content I want
 2) seemlessly wander the site till I find something that interests me

Two types of users can be defined:

1. I’m already a fan of the band, I have all their albums…
    - As a user I expect the site to reflect the persona of the band.
    - As a user I want unique content i.e. access to offical store, definitive tour schedule

2. I have just heard of this band and I want to find out more…
    - As a user I want access to the bands social media.
    - As a user I want to hear some of this bands music.
    - As a user I want to see their music videos.
    - As a user I want to see some live performances.
    - As a user I want some biographic information on the group*

 *Testing*

 Music was not working on all screens so merged containers of text and main spotify frame.
 Now that album stands out a bit more as the main new album.
